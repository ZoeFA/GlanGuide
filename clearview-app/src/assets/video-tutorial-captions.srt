00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,891
Welcome, this is a tutorial on

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,042
how to use Gl치nGuide.

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:10,054
Gl치nGuide is an accessibility checker in

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:12,635
which you can enter a URL

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,216
of any specific website or web

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,798
page and it will grade on

7
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,379
how accessible this web page is

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,530
on a variety of parameters.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,146
To start off, will take this

10
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,892
URL here to the Tea Dublin

11
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:32,725
homepage. I'm inserting it into

12
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,450
the top input field.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,934
And pressing 'Check'. This

14
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,776
is now printing out the code

15
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:43,618
to this web page, which you

16
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:46,460
can minimise by pressing the 'Collapse

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,303
Code' button and maximising by pressing

18
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,195
'Expand Code'. I can

19
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:55,109
filter this code into

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,022
images, anchors, alt text, links,

21
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:01,017
buttons, input fields. To do

22
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,723
so, I click on one such filter such

23
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,092
as images and then press the 'Filter'

24
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:06,430
button.

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,251
The accessibility grade. A

26
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:16,057
can be filtered as well. It can

27
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:18,710
grade per the filter. Or

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,290
across the whole web page. Each

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,870
error and warning is listed below.

30
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,450
Errors are in red, warnings are

31
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,354
in orange. Down below

33
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,274
